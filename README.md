2. Performance evaluation -- The effect of workloads on operating systems performance -- basic notions in queuing analysis

3. Processes -- The process abstraction -- Threads -- Multiprogramming -- Process and thread scheduling

4. Concurrency -- Mutual exclusion -- Semaphores and locks -- Deadlock prevention and avoidance

5. Memory management -- Virtual memory and address mapping -- Segmentation and contiguous allocation -- Demand paging -- Page replacement algorithms
-- Caching

6. File systems -- The file abstraction -- File naming and directories -- Access permissions and protection -- Data access -- File layout on disk
